We bring together the CISO, the hacker, the security practitioner, and the researcher in a one-of-a-kind experience you CANNOT get elsewhere.<br/><br/>We provide three+ presentation tracks, in-con workshops, and a solutions arena to ensure you get the most out of the event. Come join the conversation.<br/>And yes, free food & beer.",
