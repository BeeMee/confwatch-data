This repository contains the data files for the ConfWatch project, it is from the community for the community ❤️

Contributing
==

You can contribute by forking this repository and adding / fixing `attributes`, `categories`, `events` or `editions`.

Attributes
===

The `attributes` folder contains JSON files representing boolean attributes of conferences editions, such attributes should be kept as simple answers to questions like:

    Does this conference edition has kids friendly facilities?

Which is represented as the `kids-friendly.json` file:


```json
{
	"title": "Kids Friendly",
	"description": "The event has kids friendly facilities."
}
```

Categories
===

Similarly to the attributes, the `categories` contains json files of the events categories, such as `infosec.json`:

```json
{
	"title": "InfoSec",
	"description": "Information security."
}
```

Events
===

Events are represented as sub folders of the root `events` folder, each one having a main `event.json` file describing the main information of a conference:

```json
{
	"title": "defcon",
	"description": "originally started in 1993, it was a meant to be a party for member of \"platinum net\", a fido protocol based hacking network out of canada. as the main u.s. hub i was helping the platinum net organizer (i forget his name) plan a closing party for all the member bbs systems and their users. he was going to shut down the network when his dad took a new job and had to move away.",
	"website": "https://www.defcon.org/",
	"categories": ["infosec"]
}
```

Editions
====

Each event has an `editions` subfolder containing json files for each of the past, current and ideally future editions of the given conference, for instance, here's the file `events/defcon/editions/defcon-25.json`:

```json
{
	"title": "DEFCON 25",
	"type": 0,
	"description": "DEFCON 25 bla bla bla bla.",
	"website": "https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-25/dc-25-index.html",
